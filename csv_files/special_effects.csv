0,Partial Shield Bypass,Weapon,40% of damage bypasses shields and directly damages the hull.
1,Area Damage,Weapon,"IDK tbh. Might remove this. ChatGPT generated this one, but it doesn't make sense unless we calculate ship positions during battle or allow fleet battles."
2,Power Drain,Weapon,"For 3 turns, disables enemy shields, reduces enemy energy weapon power by 80%, and doubles all enemy weapon cooldowns."
3,Trouble with Tribbles,Weapon,"If the target ship's shields are below 10%, decreases its accuracy by 25% for 5 turns, against Klingon ships."
4,Shielding,Defense,"100% (multiplied by this defense's effectiveness) of damage this ship takes is dealt to the shields instead, until those shields reach 10%, at which point the amount of damage they absorb is equal to their current HP percentage x10. Shields stop recharging once they hit 0%, and don't start recharging unless no damage has been taken for at least 3 turns."
5,Invisibility,Defense,Reduce incoming attacks' accuracy by 100% (multiplied by this defense's effectiveness). Shields and weapons are deactivated while this is active.
6,Phasing,Defense,"Prevents 100% of damage from torpedoes and 50% of damage from all other weapons, and this ship may pass through solid objects."
7,Hull Armor,Defense,Prevent 100% (multiplied by this defense's effectiveness) of hull damage. This armor takes damage equivalent to 2/3rd of the amount of hull damage prevented. This effect stops when the associated hull armor reaches 0% HP.
