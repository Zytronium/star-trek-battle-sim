0,USS Enterprise-D,NCC-1701-D,Galaxy,United Federation of Planets,"Enterprise D was the 5th iteration of the USS Enterprise, the flagship of the Federation in Star Trek: The Next Generation.","Phaser Array, Photon Torpedoes, Quantum Torpedoes, Tribble",Deflector Shields,1750,1400,images/ships/USS_Enterprise-D.webp
1,USS Pegasus,NCC-53847,Oberth,United Federation of Planets,"The USS Pegasus was a prototype vessel that served as a testbed for various technologies, including an illegal phasing cloaking device. The Pegasus was lost in 2358 in an accident while testing the phasing cloaking device.","Phaser Array, Photon Torpedoes","Deflector Shields, Phasing Cloaking Device",1000,850,images/ships/USS_Pegasus.webp
2,USS Voyager,NCC-74656,Intrepid,United Federation of Planets,"Voyager was the first of its class, assigned to a 1-week mission, but ended up stranded in the Delta quadrant for years.","Phaser Array, Spatial charges, Photon Torpedoes, Tricobalt Warheads",Deflector Shields,1150,1000,images/ships/USS_Voyager.webp
3,USS Defiant,NX-74205,Defiant,United Federation of Planets,"The Defiant was initially a prototype warship. Smaller than the average starship, Defiant was fast, agile, powerful, and later had a Romulan cloaking device for use in the Dominion war.","Phaser Cannons, Phaser Array, Photon Torpedoes, Quantum Torpedoes, Tribble","Deflector Shields, Ablative Armor, Cloaking Device",1100,900,images/ships/USS_Defiant.webp
4,ISS Defiant,NX-74205,Defiant,Terran Resistance Forces (Mirror Universe),"The ISS Defiant, not to be confused with the USS Defiant (NX-74205) or the older USS Defiant (NCC-1764), is an identical copy of the USS Defiant (aside from not having a cloaking device). The design was based on specifications of its counterpart, the USS Defiant, which were ""acquired"" from the prime universe's Deep Space 9 in 2371. This ship has slightly more health and firepower, but fewer torpedoes and no cloaking device.","Phaser Cannons, Phaser Array, Photon Torpedoes, Quantum Torpedoes","Deflector Shields, Ablative Armor",1200,950,images/ships/ISS_Defiant.webp
5,ISS Charon,Unknown,Charon,Terran Empire (Mirror Universe),"The ISS Charon was the flagship of the Terran Empire in the Terran universe. While this ship is over 100 years older than other ships listed, it has considerable fire power and a unique power source. The Charon housed the palace of the Terran emperor before she was taken to the prime universe.","Heavy Phaser Arrays, Disruptor Cannons, Photon Torpedoes, Large Phaser Cannons, Mycelial Energy Projector","Deflector Shields, Ablative Armor",1000,650,images/ships/ISS_Charon.webp

9,Terix,I.R.C. 1969,D'deridex-class Warbird,Romulan Star Empire (Military),"The Terix discovered a hull fragment from the experimental USS Pegasus in the Devolin system in 2370. The warbird was subsequently ordered to find the rest of the ship. When the USS Enterprise-D arrived with the same mission and discovered the Pegasus, the Terix 'accidentally' sealed them inside the hollow asteroid containing the Pegasus. The Enterprise escaped using the Pegasus's experimental phasing cloaking device.","Disruptor Arrays, Phaser Array, Photon Torpedoes","Deflector Shields, Cloaking Device",1500,1300,images/ships/Terix.webp
